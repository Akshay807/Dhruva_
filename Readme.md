# Indian Roads can be fatal. On Indian roads there is one death in every 4 minutes due to road accidents. India loses one city every year due to road accidents. Two-wheelers account for around 35% of total road accidents.

The main reason behind this terrifying data is Delayed Emergency Medical Help. The accident happened remains unnoticed several times or people hesitate to help, which ultimately causes fatality. 
# If the happened accident gets noticed and information is conveyed to rescue authorities within time, Life of the bike rider can be saved.	

Problem Observed: To detect a bike crash and to convey the crash information to rescue authorities and friends/relatives in real time. ![image](https://github.com/Akshay807/Dhruva_/assets/37154329/0edf2319-5bf8-4978-887b-2de6e9630399)

Detailed Solution:
1. An electronic device rigidly mounted on the bike.
2. That experiences the same inclination and acceleration as that of bike.
3. Detects an accurate crash.
4. Reliably communicates to rescue authorities and relatives along with total information of crash.

In order to make a product to save life of peoples on road. The device needs to:
1. Reliably detect a crash, So that no false cases are detected.
2. Communicate Reliably, Convey the total information of accident required to reach the help as early as possible.
3. Safeguarded, Device should not get damaged after experiencing a crash, else it will hamper the communication.
4. Standalone, Should not be dependent on any other parameter/device to detect or communicate, else it will delay the help.

# 1. Reliable crash detection
a. Detect an accurate crash when bike is travelling.
b. Distinguish whether the crash is false crash or a true crash, So that it can act according to the situation.
c. Distinguish whether the bike is actually travelling on road or standing stationary somewhere, so that it can communicate to the appropriate concerned person.

# 2. Reliable Communication
a. Communicate to at least one of all the concerned authorities depending on current nature (riding/stationary) of bike.
b. Convey all the information required to concerned authorities to reach the crash detected place.
c. Communicate at any time, weather & location.

# 3. Safeguarded
a. Be small enough so that can be easily fixed on bike.
b. Not get damaged when bike meets an accident.
c. Be easily accessible whenever needed by the biker.
d. Not create complexity for maintenance purposes.

# 4. Standalone
a. Not be dependent on any other device/parameter to reliably detect and communicate.
b. Not be dependent on any third party app that will delay communication.
c. Should have independent power supply.

# We call such a Smart, Intelligent & Investigative device as Cognitio.
